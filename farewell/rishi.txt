Dear All,

As some of you would know, that tomorrow (Friday 6/17) is my last day. The journey in these last 12+ years in TCS & HUMANA (Digital area) has been the amazing and fulfilling and above all the ‘most cherished’ one. I feel extremely privileged having got the opportunity to know and work with so many talented individuals from diverse backgrounds who are so welcoming and friendly. It has truly been an ‘enriching life experience’ for me .

I wish all of you best of luck for all your future endeavors and aspirations. Thanks to each and every one of you that I came across during my work engagement.
