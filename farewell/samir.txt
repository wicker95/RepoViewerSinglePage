Today is my last day at Humana.  I had hoped to have a well written, thoughtful email, but as it turns out I am a terrible emailer. With that said I’ll try to keep this short so you can remember me as a smart individual, not someone that is terrible at writing emails with run on sentences.  In my time at Humana I’ve had the pleasure of meeting a lot of great people, learning from them and taking those skills to my next chapter.  I can confidently say that I wouldn’t be the engineer I am today if it wasn’t for the experience I received here.  This isn’t goodbye, but rather, see you later!
 
I would love to stay in touch with you once this email shuts down (probably in the next 48 hours!).  My contact info is below.
