Dear All, 

After 5 years of exciting journey with TCS-Humana, I am bidding adieu to purse new career opportunities and today is my last working day here. As I move on, I would like to take a moment to thank my leaders and colleagues who have trusted and provided extreme support to me in various aspects. I have truly enjoyed and will cherish this amazing experience for a long time. 

I wish you all success in the future and I am grateful for the opportunity to work!

This is not a goodbye, as I am sure we will cross our paths again. 

Please do stay in touch
