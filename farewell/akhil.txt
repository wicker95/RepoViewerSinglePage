Hello All,

As you may have already heard, Today is my last working day at Humana.

While I’m excited about the new opportunity, there’s also a big part of me that’s sad to be saying goodbye to you all. As I move on ,I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I’ve enjoyed my time here at Humana working with you all. It’s been so great working with you and getting to know you. The people here at Humana have honestly been one of the best parts of working here.

While I won’t be in the office anymore, I definitely hope you’ll keep in touch. My contact details are below, so don’t hesitate to reach out whenever.
