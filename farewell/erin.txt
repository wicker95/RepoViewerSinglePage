Hey Friends, 

Today is my last day with Humana, and I wanted to take a moment to wish you all the best. I will miss working with so many wonderful people! Whether recently or in the past, you have all encouraged me, taught me, helped me out in a pinch or otherwise been a pleasure to work with, and I truly appreciate that.

I’ll still be in the Louisville area, so if you’re here, or visiting, please don’t be a stranger! Firestar9s@gmail.com / 502-592-1403 / LinkedIn

Be excellent to each other. 

Thank you.

Erin
