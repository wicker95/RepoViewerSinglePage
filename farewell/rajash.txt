Hello everyone,

As most of you know, today is my last day with TCS and Humana. 

Itâ€™s truly been a pleasure working with all you over the past years and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank each & everyone who has supported me during my tenure in TCS and Humana.

I wish everyone the best as you move forward through your careers and life. I will miss each of you and hopefully we will cross paths again in one day.

Please keep In touch and you can always reach me at my personal email address Rajesh.jakka1@gmail.com , +91 9884474436.
